# Creating a trail for an organization with the AWS Command Line Interface<a name="cloudtrail-create-and-update-an-organizational-trail-by-using-the-aws-cli"></a>

You can create an organization trail by using the AWS CLI\. The AWS CLI is regularly updated with additional functionality and commands\. To help ensure success, be sure that you have installed or updated to a recent AWS CLI version before you begin\.

**Note**  
The examples in this section are specific to creating and updating organization trails\. For examples of using the AWS CLI to manage trails, see [Managing trails with the AWS CLI](cloudtrail-additional-cli-commands.md)\. When creating or updating an organization trail with the AWS CLI, you must use an AWS CLI profile in the management account or delegated administrator account with sufficient permissions\.  
You must configure the Amazon S3 bucket used for an organization trail with sufficient permissions\. 

## Create or update an Amazon S3 bucket to use to store the log files for an organization trail<a name="org-trail-bucket-policy"></a>

You must specify an Amazon S3 bucket to receive the log files for an organization trail\. This bucket must have a policy that allows CloudTrail to put the log files for the organization into the bucket\.

The following is an example policy for an Amazon S3 bucket named *myOrganizationBucket*\. This bucket is in an AWS account with the ID *111111111111*, which is the management account for an organization with the ID *o\-exampleorgid* that allows logging for an organization trail\. It also allows logging for the *111111111111* account in the event that the trail is changed from an organization trail to a trail for that account only\. Replace *myOrganizationBucket*, *111111111111*, *region*, and *trailName* with the appropriate values for your configuration\.

The example policy includes an `aws:SourceArn` condition key for the Amazon S3 bucket policy\. The IAM global condition key `aws:SourceArn` helps ensure that CloudTrail writes to the S3 bucket only for a specific trail or trails\. In an organization trail, the value of `aws:SourceArn` must be a trail ARN that is owned by the management account, and uses the management account ID\.

                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This example policy does not allow any users from member accounts to access the log files created for the organization\. By default, organization log files are accessible only to the management account\. For information about how to allow read access to the Amazon S3 bucket for IAM users in member accounts, see [Sharing CloudTrail log files between AWS accounts](cloudtrail-sharing-logs.md)\.

## Enabling CloudTrail as a trusted service in AWS Organizations<a name="cloudtrail-create-organization-trail-by-using-the-cli-enable-trusted-service"></a>

Before you can create an organization trail, you must first enable all features in Organizations\. For more information, see [Enabling All Features in Your Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html), or run the following command using a profile with sufficient permissions in the management account:

```
aws organizations enable-all-features
```

After you enable all features, you must configure Organizations to trust CloudTrail as a trusted service\. \.

To create the trusted service relationship between AWS Organizations and CloudTrail, open a terminal or command line and use a profile in the management account\. Run the `aws organizations enable-aws-service-access` command, as demonstrated in the following example\.

```
aws organizations enable-aws-service-access --service-principal cloudtrail.amazonaws.com
```

## Using create\-trail<a name="cloudtrail-create-organization-trail-by-using-the-cli-create-trail"></a>

### Creating an organization trail that applies to all regions<a name="cloudtrail-create-organization-trail-by-using-the-cli-create-trail-all"></a>

To create an organization trail that applies to all regions, add the `--is-organization-trail` and `--is-multi-region-trail` options\.

**Note**  
When you create or update an organization trail with the AWS CLI, you must use an AWS CLI profile in the management account or delegated administrator account with sufficient permissions\.

The following example creates an organization trail that delivers logs from all regions to an existing bucket named `my-bucket`:

```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name my-trail --s3-bucket-name my-bucket --is-organization-trail --is-multi-region-trail
```

To confirm that your trail exists in all regions, the `IsOrganizationTrail` and `IsMultiRegionTrail` parameters in the output are both set to `true`:

```
{
    "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": true, 
    "Name": "my-trail", 
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/my-trail", 
    "LogFileValidationEnabled": false, 
    "IsMultiRegionTrail": true, 
    "IsOrganizationTrail": true,
    "S3BucketName": "my-bucket"
}
```

**Note**  
Run the `start-logging` command to start logging for your trail\. For more information, see [Stopping and starting logging for a trail](cloudtrail-additional-cli-commands.md#cloudtrail-start-stop-logging-cli-commands)\.

### Creating an organization trail as a single\-region trail<a name="cloudtrail-create-organization-trail-by-using-the-cli-single"></a>

The following command creates an organization trail that only logs events in a single AWS Region, also known as a single\-region trail\. The AWS Region where events are logged is the region specified in the configuration profile for the AWS CLI\.

```
aws cloudtrail create-trail --name my-trail --s3-bucket-name my-bucket --is-organization-trail
```

For more information, see [CloudTrail trail naming requirements](cloudtrail-trail-naming-requirements.md)\.

Sample output:

```
{
    "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": true, 
    "Name": "my-trail", 
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/my-trail", 
    "LogFileValidationEnabled": false,
    "IsMultiRegionTrail": false,
    "IsOrganizationTrail": true,
    "S3BucketName": "my-bucket"
}
```

By default, the `create-trail` command creates a single\-region trail that does not enable log file validation\.

**Note**  
Run the `start-logging` command to start logging for your trail\.

## Running update\-trail to update an organization trail<a name="cloudtrail-update-organization-trail-by-using-the-cli"></a>

You can run the `update-trail` command to change the configuration settings for an organization trail, or to apply an existing trail for a single AWS account to an entire organization\. Remember that you can run the `update-trail` command only from the region in which the trail was created\.

**Note**  
If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs to update a trail, be sure that the trail's bucket policy is up\-to\-date\. For more information, see [Creating a trail for an organization with the AWS Command Line Interface](#cloudtrail-create-and-update-an-organizational-trail-by-using-the-aws-cli)\.  
When you create or update an organization trail with the AWS CLI, you must use an AWS CLI profile in the management account or delegated administrator account with sufficient permissions\.

### Applying an existing trail to an organization<a name="cloudtrail-update-organization-trail-by-using-the-cli-apply-org"></a>

To change an existing trail so that it also applies to an organization instead of a single AWS account, add the `--is-organization-trail` option, as shown in the following example\.

```
aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail --is-organization-trail
```

To confirm that the trail now applies to the organization, the `IsOrganizationTrail` parameter in the output has a value of `true`\.

```
{
    "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": true, 
    "Name": "my-trail", 
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/my-trail", 
    "LogFileValidationEnabled": false, 
    "IsMultiRegionTrail": true, 
    "IsOrganizationTrail": true, 
    "S3BucketName": "my-bucket"
}
```

In the preceding example, the trail was configured to apply to all regions \(`"IsMultiRegionTrail": true`\)\. A trail that applied only to a single region would show `"IsMultiRegionTrail": false` in the output\.

### Converting an organization trail that applies to one region to apply to all regions<a name="cloudtrail-update-organization-trail-by-using-the-cli-single-to-all"></a>

To change an existing organization trail so that it applies to all regions, add the `--is-multi-region-trail` option as shown in the following example\.

```
aws cloudtrail update-trail --name my-trail --is-multi-region-trail
```

To confirm that the trail now applies to all regions, the `IsMultiRegionTrail` parameter in the output has a value of `true`\.

```
{
    "IncludeGlobalServiceEvents": true, 
    "Name": "my-trail", 
    "TrailARN": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/my-trail", 
    "LogFileValidationEnabled": false, 
    "IsMultiRegionTrail": true, 
    "IsOrganizationTrail": true,
    "S3BucketName": "my-bucket"
}
```
