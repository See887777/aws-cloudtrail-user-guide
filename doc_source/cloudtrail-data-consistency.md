# Managing data consistency in CloudTrail<a name="cloudtrail-data-consistency"></a>

CloudTrail uses a distributed computing model called [eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency)\. Any change that you make to your CloudTrail configuration \(or other AWS services\), including tags used in [attribute\-based access control \(ABAC\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html), takes time to become visible from all possible endpoints\. Some of the delay results from the time it takes to send the data from server to server, from replication zone to replication zone, and from Region to Region around the world\. CloudTrail also uses caching to improve performance, but in some cases this can add time\. The change might not be visible until the previously cached data times out\. 

 You must design your applications to account for these potential delays\. Ensure that they work as expected, even when a change made in one location is not instantly visible at another\. Such changes include creating or updating trails or event data stores, updating event selectors, and starting or stopping logging\. When you create or update a trail or event data store, CloudTrail delivers logs to the S3 bucket or event data store based on the last known configuration until the changes propagate to all locations\.
