After you save query results, you can download the saved query results from the S3 bucket\. For more information about finding and downloading saved query results, see [Get and download saved query results](view-download-cloudtrail-lake-query-results.md)\.

You can also validate saved query results to determine whether the query results were modified, deleted, or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered the query results\.
