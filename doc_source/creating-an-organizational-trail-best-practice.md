# Best practices for moving from member account trails to organization trails<a name="creating-an-organizational-trail-best-practice"></a>

If you already have CloudTrail trails configured for individual member accounts, but want to move to an organization trail to log events in all accounts, you do not want to lose events by deleting individual member account trails before you create an organization trail\. But when you have two trails, you incur higher costs because of the additional copy of events delivered to the organization trail\.

To help manage costs, but avoid losing events before log delivery starts on the organization trail, consider keeping both your individual member account trails and your organization trail for up to one day\. This ensures that the organization trail logs all events, but you incur duplicate event costs only for one day\. After the first day, you can stop logging on \(or delete\) any individual member account trails\.
